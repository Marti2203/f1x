f1x [ɛf-wʌn-ɛks] is a test-driven patch generation engine for C/C++ programs. It automatically finds and fixes software bugs by analyzing behaviour of passing and failing tests. f1x aims to be efficient, predictable and easy-to-use.

## Documentation ##

In order to install f1x you can either [build it from source](doc/BuildFromSource.md) (recommended) or try an older version [available on VirtualBox VM](doc/VirtualBox.md).

The quickest way to get started with f1x is to go though our [tutorial](doc/Tutorial.md). More detailed information about the tool and the underlying algorithms is given in the [manual](doc/Manual.md). If you encounter a problem while using f1x, please consult the [troubleshooting guide](doc/Troubleshooting.md) or ask us by email (contact: Sergey Mechtaev, `mechtaev@comp.nus.edu.sg`). If you plan to modify f1x, please refer to the [developer guide](doc/Development.md).

f1x has been evaluated on several automated program repair benchmarks. We provide environment for reproducing [experiments with Genprog ICSE'12 benchmark](https://github.com/mechtaev/f1x-genprog-icse12) and [experiments with IntroClass benchmark](https://github.com/stan6/f1x-introclass).
